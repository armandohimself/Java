# Java Study Guide

Java is a strictly OOP (Object Orientated Programming) language which means it has heavy emphasis on creating objects using these things called **classes**. The best way to think about this is when you want to descibe the state and behavior of a real world object represented in code.

**Example:**
Think about an ant. The ant has legs, antennas, and other characteristics like color, etc. These are your states knowing what is to be true about the ant. The ant can also move, attack, defend, etc. These are behaviors that the ant can represent. Your states/ characteristics will be known as fields and the behavior it exhibits will be known as methods.

Objects interact with other objects through methods much like an input-ouput machine.

When it comes to what happens under the hood about these data members (fields and methods) just know that once an object is created, it will contain an address and take up some memory. Memory and addresses being your RAM and space like your hard drive or somewhere where the data is stored that can be later retrieved.
