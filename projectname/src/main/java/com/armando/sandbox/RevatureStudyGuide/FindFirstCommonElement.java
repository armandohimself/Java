/*
 * Prompt:
Write the logic for the findCommon method to find and return the first common integer between two arrays (arr1 and arr2). Follow these steps:

Understand the Inputs and Outputs:

Inputs:
Two integer arrays: arr1 and arr2.
Output:
The first common integer found in both arrays. If no common integer exists, return null.
Think About the Logic:

Compare each element in arr1 with each element in arr2.
Use a nested loop to iterate through both arrays.
When a common integer is found, immediately return it.
Edge Cases to Consider:

One or both arrays are empty.
No common integers exist between the arrays.
Arrays contain duplicate integers.
Optimization (Optional):

If youâ€™ve learned about sets or hash tables, consider using them to make the search faster instead of using nested loops.
