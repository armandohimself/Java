/*
 * Exercises (Optional)
If not done previously, do the first two steps. If you have already done Steps 1 and 2, proceed to Step 3

Step 1
Create a MathOps class and create the following method:
[X] add : Accept two int parameters, and return their sum.
[] Create the TestMathOps class and demonstrate the usage of the annotations and assert methods. Run the test and show the output.

Step 2
Create test methods for subtract and divide methods before writing them in MathOps.

Step 3
Create the ParameterizedMathTest class and explain the RunWith and Parameter annotations. Build the class and its test method.
