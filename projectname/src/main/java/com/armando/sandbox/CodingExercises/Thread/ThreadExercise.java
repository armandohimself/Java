/*
 * Exercise (Optional)
Can you get errors by using an unsynchronized counter with multiple threads? 
Write a program to find out. Use the following unsynchronized Counter class, which you can include as a nested class in your program:

static class Counter { int count; void inc() { count = count+1; } int getCount() { return count; } }

Write a Thread class that will repeatedly call the inc() method in an object of type Counter. 
The object should be a shared global variable. 
Create several threads, start them all, and wait for all the threads to terminate. 
Print the final value of the counter, and see whether it is correct.

Let the user enter the number of threads and the number of times that each thread will increment the counter. 
You might need a fairly large number of increments to see an error. 
And of course there can never be any error if you use just one thread. 
Your program can use join() to wait for a thread to terminate.
