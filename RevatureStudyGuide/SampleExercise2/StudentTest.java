/*
 * What ChatGPT has to say about my exercise ðŸ«¡
 * 
 * //!Suggestions for Improvement:
[]  Naming Conventions: The class Student uses a variable name studentID but the method is getStudentID() and setStudentID(). In Java, it's typical to use camelCase for variable names, so studentId would be more conventional.
[X] Package Declaration: Make sure your package declaration (package SampleExercise2;) matches the directory structure of your project to avoid any compile-time or runtime issues if using packages.
[]  Constructor Enhancement: Although not required, you might consider adding a parameterized constructor to your Student class to allow setting all properties at the time of object creation. This can make your class more flexible and easy to use.

Enhanced Constructor Example:
Adding a constructor that takes parameters for all the fields could look like this:
* //! Parameterized constructor

Student(int studentId, String studentName, String collegeName, String studentAddress) {
    this.studentId = studentId;
    this.studentName = studentName;
    this.collegeName = collegeName;
    this.studentAddress = studentAddress;
}
